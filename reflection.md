- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I can understand how this would be helpful for other projects in the future. I feel like in this assignment, it didn't seem to have a lot of use besides storing a name and a toString() method. Besides that, there were lots of differences. It did streamline my code though.  
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Unfortunately, pseudocode worked really well this time around. So did looking at official Java documentation to an extent. I'm still a little unclear about how to use it most effectively so Googling was helpful in that way. I do now understand better the reasoning behind having something be private.
